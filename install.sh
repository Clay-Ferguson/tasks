# VSCode Timex Extension Build and Install Script
# 
# This script automates the complete build and installation process for the 
# Timex VSCode extension. It performs the following steps:
# 1. Installs npm dependencies
# 2. Compiles the TypeScript source code
# 3. Packages the extension into a .vsix file using vsce
# 4. Installs the packaged extension into VS Code
#
# The extension provides minimalist task management using
# markdown files with #task hashtags and timestamps.

# Exit on any error
set -e

# Function to handle errors
